what are axios?

it is an http library or an http client to make request to your backend or other third party api to fetch data
it is somewhat similar to the fetch api but it has great syntax make it easy to use.

basically it helps you to communicate with your backend .


to use axios:-

inside the function 

{
    axios({
        method:-you want to use like:-"get",
        url :- that you want to fetch
    }).then:-cause it is going to return a promise
}

url= base url/route

route is like a path what you put here will tell the server/backend where you want to go/what is exactly you are requesting for
